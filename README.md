# CERF-23-r-workshop
Workshop Goals:
* Show off how shiny apps work so people know what is possible and they can scope potential work for themselves in the future.
* Give basic ability to copy-paste R code, run it, and see what happens.

Planning meetings are last Monday of the month 11:00 ET.

## example content
* [biodiv explorer flex dashboard (static)](https://marinebon.github.io/p2p-dashboard/biodivExplorer_beach.html#general-information)
* [seacapeR as quarto](TODO)
* [More possible examples @ p2p/data_science](https://marinebon.github.io/p2p/methods_data_science.html)

## app design options
* reports vs dashboards
* what tech you need (shiny vs quarto etc) depends on a lot of things:
    * size of data
    * size of data transformation search space (can it be precomputed or do you need arbitrary-code execution)
    * how often the view needs to be updated
